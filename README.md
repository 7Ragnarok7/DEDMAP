# *DEDMAP*
[![Python-ico](https://github.com/7Ragnarok7/DEDMAP/blob/master/image-src/python-logo.png?raw=true)][py]  

##### DEDMAP is a ***Simple*** but ***Powerful*** Cross-Platform [Port Scanning][ps] tool made with ease to use and convenience in mind. 

Both TCP and UDP protocols have 0 to 65535 ports. These 65535 ports can be divided into the following three ranges:-
- System or well-known ports: from 0 to 1023
- User or registered ports: from 1024 to 49151
- Dynamic or private ports: all > 49151 

**DEDMAP** tries to scan a target ip or range of ip's and find services that are running and listening on some ports.

### Requirements :-
